## Sample Poems from _Learning American_ (1998)

<h3>THE  OLD PLACE</h3>
<p> They live  with a decay he never notices<br />
    behind their  trailer the old two-story house,<br />
    paint  shaggy, windows gone, in the thick nest of trees.</p>
<p>She wants it  torn down. He doesn&rsquo;t see the use <br />
    of that  work. It isn&rsquo;t hurting anyone, he says<br />
    when she  brings it up. She can&rsquo;t tell him how</p>
<p>it hurts,  cracks etching down the walls, the crazed<br />
    linoleum,  its grit of glass, and&mdash;worse than that&mdash;<br />
    the people  she is sure live there, who gather food</p>
<p>out of the  vacant earth with rusted tools,<br />
    collect  themselves at night in the single glare<br />
    of the  kitchen light around the table, counting</p>
<p>their money  on the oilcloth, setting it aside,<br />
    who ask each  other what they remember,<br />
    reminding  themselves in long, loud stories,</p>
<p>who plan&mdash;and  this is the worst of all&mdash;who plan<br />
    again and  again. It is this harsh joy burning<br />
    in the  village of the dead she can&rsquo;t bear</p>

<h3>QUARTET</h3>
<p>In  cafes like this for a thousand miles<br />
    there  are these four people: an old husband,<br />
    a  wife, and two close widows, a ring<br />
    of  broken circles, what they expected<br />
    if  they had been asked to expect anything.<br />
    Levels  of loss expand around the table.<br />
    These  two feel empty chairs at their elbows<br />
    and  the wife, in sharing, feels each day<br />
    something  missing which has not yet happened.</p>
<p>The  last husband left grows more a widow too,<br />
    each  year his voice getting gentler and sadder<br />
    and,  right now, a woman wonders something.<br />
    He  searches for his opinion in the old way.</p>
<p>He  must have an answer, it seems, some fact<br />
    he  can recount. He pauses, trying to find<br />
    enough  certainty for three men. The women wait.<br />
    In Miles City, Cheyenne, Morning  Springs,<br />
    the  service slows in the caf&eacute;, the silence widens. </p>
