title: What I do for Others
---

<p>I need my wife around--I think<br />
tonight, as I wash the pan I fried<br />
bacon and potatoes in--to cook<br />
for her, in which case I&rsquo;d poach<br />
a little sole with a Korean<br />
dipping sauce and maybe some baby<br />
greens just touched with vinegar.</p>
<p>This is the way I help others,<br />
how I satisfy the dentist&rsquo;s<br />
compulsive worries over my teeth,<br />
the doctor&rsquo;s concerns for my  health. </p>
<p>Almost every day I stop by<br />
the Loaf and Jug where the clerk<br />
needs money but is afraid to ask<br />
so I give him some, although to  shield<br />
his embarrassment he hands me one<br />
of the cigars he&rsquo;s hired to guard.</p>
<p>And sometimes, wife away, I eat<br />
at the little caf&eacute; down town<br />
so the waitress has someone<br />
to call honey. After I leave,<br />
she feels warm and full all night. </p>

<p> As with many of my poems, the  concept starts with reality. As my wife has a full-time job and I&rsquo;m retired, I  do &lsquo;&rdquo;help&rdquo; out by cooking. Making my own dinner one night when she had a  meeting, I realized the difference between what I&rsquo;d cook for myself and what  I&rsquo;d cook for the both of us (something better). This led to the strange  reversal of doing things one would do for oneself to doing it for other people,  e.g. going to the dentist to help the dentist, to the doctor to help him. I was  charmed by this speaker who put everything onto others and tried to keep it up  by imagining that I was helping a clerk when I bought a cigar and, finally,  that I was helping a waitress by eating out. I end with the absurd reversal  that she feels &ldquo;warm and full all night&rdquo;, understanding that it is obviously  the speaker who ends up that way. </p>
<p>The rhythm of the lines vary from  7 to 9 syllables, a favorite form of mine, as working with syllables allows one  to keep the lines roughly the same length and yet vary them so the rhythm  sounds fairly conversational. </p>
