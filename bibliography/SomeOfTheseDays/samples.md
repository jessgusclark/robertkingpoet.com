<h2>Sample Poems from Some of These Days (Conundrum Press, 2013)</h2>
    
<h3>WHY I INVENTED WAR </h3>
<p>Only because I had soldiers. <br />
    Given a set of lead cows, I would  have <br />
    invented agriculture, the morning&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
driving to the fields, the evening  back, </p>
<p>one barking dog, one herd-boy  singing,<br />
    after I&rsquo;d invented song, and  strolling<br />
    back to the unruffled house. I  would have <br />
    invented houses, drawn a spiral of  smoke </p>
<p>from each chimney in town. Would  have invented <br />
    towns. Would have invented fire  for each hearth, <br />
    invented hearths, invented water  to <br />
    put out fires, and because I had  water</p>
<p>I would have invented flowers. But  I had <br />
    only soldiers. This went on for  years.</p>
    
<h3>AT FIFTEEN </h3>
    
<p>At the first hard shock, a first love&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
    overturned in the instant of a letter,<br />
I was burned by the hurt, if not</p>
<p>in the heart, that tight affectionate knot,<br />
    then in the chest, an ache swelling up. <br />
    That night I lay in bed watching the rain</p>
<p>burst over our small troubled trees<br />
    and cried, mostly from pain but partly,<br />
    that young, in tune with the storm&rsquo;s torrent,</p>
<p>until I stopped. But then, wanting back<br />
    that bitter pang, I counted up<br />
    every lost thing until I broke out again,</p>
<p>glorying in my new sadness,<br />
    delighted to feel it, to feel, my small life<br />
    as large as the worldly rain. </p>
    
<h3>BIRDS AND DEATH AND BEAUTY</h3>
    
<p>Buson once saw the iris-<br />
    colored droppings of a bird<br />
    fallen onto an iris colored<br />
like the droppings of a bird.</p>
<p>I, on the other hand, see<br />
    a tired, red-haired woman, dyed,<br />
    I presume, deposit a handful <br />
    of letters in the mailbox</p>
<p>and enter the coffee shop<br />
    I&rsquo;m visiting before seeing<br />
    my father. For an hour I think<br />
    of myself, then the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I crook my arm, the world&rsquo;s  crooked,&rdquo;<br />
    wrote Takahashi&mdash;a sparrow<br />
    changing the universe&mdash;who&rsquo;s now  dead,<br />
    born six years before father.</p>
<p>Later, we sit together<br />
    staring out of his window<br />
    either at trees the dark shade of  earth<br />
    erupting into blossom</p>
<p>or the parking lot where cars<br />
    seem dead, a few birds dribbling<br />
    their pastels, sermon upon sermon:<br />
    how beauty comes when it comes,</p>
<p>how beauty goes when it goes,<br />
    how we can recognize it,<br />
    how we can sit and love in  silence,<br />
    how silence is the last word. </p>
    
<h3>THE FUNNY TRAVELER IN OMAHA&nbsp; <br />
</h3>
<p>When I put up, by association of parts,<br />
    my umbrella I become Portuguese<br />
along an Omaha street because I</p>
<p>bought it in Portugal, a Saturday market<br />
    in a small town, men standing in clusters<br />
    on one side of the street, the women, mostly</p>
<p>in black, on the other, a divided village<br />
    in separate knots, two sides for marriages<br />
    to get away from each other.</p>
<p>Suddenly in the market there came a downpour<br />
    and I was standing beside the seller <br />
    of big umbrellas and if it had rained</p>
<p>all day&mdash;and I had places to go, I couldn&rsquo;t<br />
    stand around not-talking to the men&mdash;I was ready<br />
    although it only rained three minutes so I had</p>
<p>this large black sculpture to carry around two weeks<br />
    but now I can use it in Omaha,<br />
    light drops ticking like a dozen watches</p>
<p>on the tight drum-skin of my contrivance.<br />
    Let&rsquo;s face it, the umbrella is comic,<br />
    the funniest amenity we&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>The duck, of course, is the funniest animal, <br />
    not mallards but the children&rsquo;s barnyard-book-<br />
    duck, he and she of the orange bill and feet</p>
<p>and the white plump decoy of a body.<br />
    The bicycle is the funniest machine,<br />
    if you&rsquo;re keeping a list, because all its parts</p>
<p>are so visible. A car is mysterious,<br />
    or a jet, because its parts are hidden<br />
    but if you&rsquo;ve looked at a bicycle you can  </p>
<p>make one although perhaps not a good one.<br />
    An umbrella is comic because<br />
    it&rsquo;s that obvious a thing. There&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>a certain sense of self-importance one exudes<br />
    carrying an umbrella and someone else&rsquo;s<br />
    self-importance is also funny</p>
<p>the way I am now, under my umbrella<br />
    in the fragile rain which is not like the drench<br />
    on Gene Kelly in a street in &ldquo;An American in Paris,&rdquo; </p>
<p>the first movie I took a girl to, Jayne, a Baptist, who,<br />
    when I remarked on the way home how exciting it was,<br />
    though going with a girl was the most exciting part,</p>
<p>said she thought it was very &ldquo;carnal.&rdquo; Who<br />
    but a Baptist girl would use that word? I&rsquo;m sorry I left<br />
    Jayne or she left me but not really, so long afterward now,</p>
    
<p>but I am sorry I had to leave the Portuguese market<br />
    and I&rsquo;m also afraid, no one else on the street<br />
    carrying an umbrella, that I&rsquo;m surely</p>
<p>a comic figure, an old duck riding a new bicycle, <br />
    because although it shows I&rsquo;m well-traveled<br />
    no one else knows that and I think of singing</p>
<p>a chorus or two about rain and Jayne<br />
    but (see under &ldquo;Umbrella, comic&rdquo;) I&rsquo;d look<br />
    even funnier and to all of Omaha. </p>
    
<h3>SHOES&nbsp; </h3>
<p>Shoes are a symbol, I once thought, looking down<br />
    at my young lover&rsquo;s Birkenstocks, tiny boats <br />
    of love moored by the bed while she showered,<br />
poignant, but when she put them on, I forgot them. </p>
<p>(I am not speaking here of the one high heel <br />
    found in a hotel elevator, or the lump of a shoe <br />
    rumbled over on the highway, or two <br />
    tied and tossed to dangle, helpless, from a wire.)</p>
<p>I have worn in my life clod-hoppers, gun-boats, <br />
    white bucks, blue suede, oxfords, boots, penny-loafers, <br />
    sneakers, tennis-shoes, sandals (like Christ <br />
    I first thought&mdash;later, like Allen Ginsberg).</p>
<p>Of course we think about shoes mainly when they&rsquo;re off, <br />
    in a muddle by the front door, the kids&rsquo; tumbled <br />
    in a corner, or your love&rsquo;s empty lovelies, or yours<br />
    when they&rsquo;re tired, parked in front of your chair.</p>
<p>Later, our shoes slip-on or have Velcro tabs <br />
    so we don&rsquo;t have to fumble with those first lessons.<br />
    At the last, someone takes ours off. We won&rsquo;t <br />
    need them anymore. Death, you see, is soft. </p>
