<h2>Reviews: <em>Naming Names</em> (Palanquin Press, 2001; 2nd edition 2006)</h2>
<p>&ldquo;These poems burst their boundaries up and down and margin  outwards towards the still untamed infinity of words, work their coordinates  through restless references and indexes always towards a greater shifting irony  that bends and warps like bodies in a fun house mirror. No discipline measured  in either language or numbers escapes his testing, no starting point so  commonplace its mystery and strangeness does not taunt him and tease us. What results  is the naming of <em>Naming Names</em>, part  Adam's assertion of the world, part necessary price of admission to the  numinous carnival of plenitude which is our lives. Always somehow, through it  all, Bob retains his fresh-faced enthusiasm and his wry good humor.&rdquo; (Greg  Kuzma) </p>
<p>&ldquo;I love the freedoms Bob calls on in the longer poems, and the  fact that he's taken the poems on, to spin their stories out as if they carried  knots that tightened and then slipped free.&rdquo; (Jay Meek) </p>
<p>&ldquo;What a funny, intelligent poet King is! I admire his serious  sense of play.&rdquo; (Twyla Hansen) </p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;A boffo performance!&rdquo; (Phebe Davidson, editor  of Palanquin Press)</p>
