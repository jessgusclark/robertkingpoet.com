<h2>RODIN AT SCHOOL</h2>
<p>Say you&rsquo;re going to school in the  19th century<br />
    a rough little peasant who can barely  read or write,<br />
    and one day, the other boys  outside, you find yourself<br />
    alone in the echoing classroom and  there&rsquo;s the chair<br />
of the professor, inviting like an  empty throne.</p>
<p>You might have stolen quietly up  to see the world<br />
    from that position and, feeling  its authority,<br />
    begun to lecture on whatever you  thought, even<br />
    rapping the desk as you contrived  what sounded like truth<br />
    or brandishing your dramatic arm  to make a point</p>
<p>although, if you&rsquo;d never dared or  even thought of it,<br />
    had been, let&rsquo;s say, outside with  the boys and then come back,<br />
    you would have joined the  boisterous jeers, laughing, pointing<br />
    to shame this dull, dumb, dreamy,  presumptuous urchin<br />
    and all the dignity he foolishly  pretended.</p>
<p>What did any of you know about  what would happen?<br />
    What did you know about love, art,  women in the nude?<br />
    Red-faced, you danced in derision  at this raw child.<br />
    Red-faced, you sat, not sure what  law you&rsquo;d broken, never<br />
    imagining the world would  stand&nbsp; unclothed before you.            </p>
<h2>HANDS</h2>
<p><em>&hellip;that rise, irritated and in wrath&hellip;. Hands  that walk, sleeping hands, and hands</em> <em>that are awakening;  criminal hands&hellip;and hands that are tired and will do no more.</em><br />
(Rilke)</p>
<p>I look at my own, the left<br />
    a curled little animal<br />
    or a cup of open desire.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a history of hands,<br />
    Rilke wrote, but I cannot<br />
    read mine, its plumps and plushes.</p>
<p>Rodin&rsquo;s was &ldquo;The Hand Emerging<br />
    from the Tomb,&rdquo; &ldquo;Devil Holding<br />
    a Woman,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Hand of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My own is the &ldquo;Hand Which Smoothes<br />
    the Hair,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hand Holding My Chin,&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;The Hand with a Heavy Spoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My last hands may scuttle off<br />
    like &ldquo;sick animals that know<br />
    no one can help,&rdquo; Rilke wrote.</p>
<p>Rilke wrote. Rodin sculpted.<br />
    Work of the hands, work of the<br />
    hands, the hands&rsquo; pure busy work.</p>
<p>Rodin&rsquo;s last hands were busy<br />
    and sick. Denied clay, even<br />
    a pen or pencil for fear</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d make a new will, his hands<br />
    nibbled at something unseen,<br />
    fingers rubbing thumbs, those twin</p>
<p>dumb necessities made for<br />
    opening and closing, for<br />
    holding on, for letting go. </p>
