title: Snow

<p>On the radio, a man speaks of the sky.<br />
Something is falling, something is falling.</p>
<p>The evening news drifts down the alleys<br />
scalloping the delicate fire-escapes.</p>
<p>Outside the red neon of the bar,<br />
sugar, like music, fills the gutters up.</p>
<p>Tonight&rsquo;s bankruptcy hides the traffic lights<br />
blinking yellow in the abandoned town.</p>
<p>Politics melts on the tip of your tongue.<br />
Each corporation has six points.</p>
<p>The houses are banked deeply by wishes. <br />
The yards thicken and soften with answers.</p>
<p>Out in the country, memories of dead friends<br />
edge onto the highway in fingers and fringes.</p>
<p>Silver buffalo lie down along the road,<br />
shifting in their sleep in the dark wind</p>
<p>which also eats away at the thick banks<br />
of commerce filling and swelling the fields.</p>
<p>An immense acceptance lifts and settles<br />
in small hollows around the trunks of trees.</p>
<p>Half-dreams sift through the broken barn roof.<br />
Love cuts at the bare branches of the windbreak.</p>
<p>The sky settles to the ground around the house,<br />
the ground lifting itself&nbsp;  lightly into the sky,</p>
<p>someone in the house talking over and over. </p>

<h2><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a>Commentary:</h2>
<p> This poem &lsquo;started&rsquo; as I listened  to a TV weatherman and wanted to write a line that would be slightly off; thus,  instead of speaking of &ldquo;snow&rdquo; he speaks of &ldquo;the sky&rdquo;.&nbsp; Once I&rsquo;d used &lsquo;snow&rsquo; as the title, I found I  could write about snow in the whole poem without mentioning it. Instead of snow  drifting, the news is drifting. I then wrote on, finding or brainstorming  abstractions or generalizations (bankruptcy, politics, wishes, answers,  memories, etc.) to use instead of the actual subject &lsquo;snow&rsquo;. This awakened a  strange feeling in me as I wrote, not only about houses and dead friends and  commerce but about the snowfall itself as the images relentlessly poured out. A  poetic &lsquo;problem&rsquo; with this kind of poem, which could go on and on as there is  no logical structure, is how to end it. In this case, I brought it back to the  &lsquo;sky&rsquo; which brought in the beginning of the poem, making it a kind of circular  meditation.</p>
<p>Regarding the form of the lines, I  was working with a loose 10-syllable line, varying it on occasion. Many of the  lines are end-stopped (i.e. in sentences) as I moved from one idea to another.</p>
