<h3>WHAT  IT WAS LIKE THOSE DAYS</h3>
<p>Since,  as a child, I was happy<br />
    as a  child, I thought every one<br />
    was  happy, including the grimy man<br />
    who  lived at the city dump in a shack<br />
    decorated  with hubcaps, broken chairs<br />
    by  the door cheerfully facing out to a waste,<br />
    those  days, of rubble smoking and oily dirt,<br />
    although  it was a strange kind of happiness<br />
    I  knew I wouldn&rsquo;t ever know.<br />
    Even  the dead, I thought then,<br />
    grinning  as I biked around town,<br />
    were  happy in their own way.<br />
    That&rsquo;s  what it was like.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;TAKE-OUT  POINT</h3>
<p>&nbsp;The  young are throwing themselves off bridges<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  this Sunday afternoon as my friend and I drift, <br />
    old  men, around the bend--the river curling <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  into shallows, depths, for only a moment all day--</p>
<p>to  lurch aground as the skinny bomb of a boy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  streamlines feet first and splash, two girls <br />
    in  tiny swimsuits by the sun-hot car leisurely<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  murmuring their no doubt astonishing secrets. </p>
<p>We  are aged enough they might think we were<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  set adrift to die, if they thought of us, <br />
    so  nonchalant toward the world<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  they seem charmed, aloof, under a bridge</p>
<p>recording  their names, years, all of us spending <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  our lives, wasting them wonderfully <br />
    in  the same direction. We stand around, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  pretending not to notice, then load canoe<br />
    as  boy climbs into car with girls, gunning the way <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  up hill toward home, river carrying <br />
    the  salt of their sweet skin to some Atlantic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  as we drive gingerly into the next near future. </p>
