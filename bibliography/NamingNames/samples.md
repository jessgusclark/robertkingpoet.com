<h3>NAMING NAMES</h3>
<p>I love the words  of the name red winged black bird<br />
    though my  philosopher daughter tells me descriptions<br />
    are not real  names. And oh I know how the words fail,</p>
<p>turning bright  blue prairie blossoms to Spiderwort<br />
    a farmer calls  Cow Slobber. And I know how lazy<br />
    and local we get,  talking of buffalo berry, buffalo bird</p>
<p>and grass, Indian  grass or fig. Someone called it<br />
    Indian bean, the  broad catalpa, a tree I met in Kansas<br />
    as a child, that  place that means the wind, wind people,</p>
<p>south-wind  people, a tree whose sound meant flowers,<br />
&ldquo;head with  wings,&rdquo; in the round mouths of the Creek,<br />
    a tree which is  Bignonia, imagine, in New Latin, when</p>
<p>we wanted to be  neutral as science and hence named <br />
    a tree for the  Abbe Bignon, New Latin librarian <br />
    to Louis XIV,  hence honoring air again. &ldquo;Te amo&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
    my 8th grade  girlfriend&rsquo;s friends dared Jayne to say<br />
    which didn&rsquo;t mean  she loved me, since it was<br />
    another language.  Later, I took Latin and by now</p>
<p>Miss Hixon&rsquo;s  joined Marcus Aurelius who joined, <br />
    as he knew he  would, three men he names <br />
    as learning from  and of whom, a footnote says, </p>
<p>&ldquo;nothing is  known&rdquo; and who, anyway, wrote in Greek<br />
    or, for all we  know, water. Or the air. Might as well<br />
    be air, I&rsquo;ve thought,  language only a shape of lips.</p>
<p>In Mabel Hixon&rsquo;s  Latin class, Gene sat heavily<br />
    beside me in his  stained work-clothes, his face<br />
    a laborious  puzzle over the text, the rest of  us&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
    wondering why he  read, why he was even  there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
    At our 40th  reunion, he turned out to own <br />
    the county&rsquo;s  biggest truck farm, thank you, </p>
<p>planting food in  Latin--a union of onions, <br />
    the radical roots  of the radish--and other tongues,<br />
    tomat, batata,  the ancient bha-bha of the bean, </p>
<p>the grains of  corn gardeners first called maize,<br />
    and the people  ate the names and they were good. <br />
    It doesn&rsquo;t matter  we give every wind a name</p>
<p>that dies, Mabel  and Marcus other people now. <br />
    This breathing  sound is how we call, our only ways<br />
    to say te amo to  the air and bring it back again, </p>
<p>te amo to the  black bird with its red spot wing, <br />
    te amo tomato and  rosy wort, and green grass grown<br />
    and Gene and  Jayne and all the, all the names. </p>

<h3>FALLING ASLEEP IN  FLORIDA</h3>
<p>In the rich hotel  of the body let's say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  there are palms growing from golden buckets.<br />
    No one waters  them and yet they grow</p>
<p>amazingly without  attention. Or say <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  someone waters them, that's their only job <br />
    in this hotel  closing up for the night.</p>
<p>Say this person  is walking toward a bus-stop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  and a police car sirens by. Say that wail--<br />
    we are out of the  body now, heading toward </p>
<p>the bus, toward  home--is the color of fire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  or the exact shade of an actress's full lips<br />
    at the beginning  of shooting a film</p>
<p>but not the day  they finish shooting the film<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  when she walks toward the car taking her home<br />
    and meets people  coming out of a rich hotel.</p>
<p>Everyone, this is  the point, is leaving the hotel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  the body, I mean, and never coming back.<br />
    Security people  in matching suits check out</p>
<p>room after empty  room, mutter &quot;Copy&quot;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  at the black plastic static of constant requests:&nbsp; <br />
&quot;Everything,&quot;  one of them reports, &quot;under control.&quot;</p>
