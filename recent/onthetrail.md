<p>I pass the sign, &ldquo;Entering Wilderness,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sit  down on a rock. So this<br />
is what it&rsquo;s like. Below, the little water<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spills from  one shelf to another<br />
along the fault of a catastrophe</p>
<p>although gingerly, this step, that one, pool<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and  pouring, smooth light visible<br />
over original granite, stone before<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life, stone  that was and is again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m told intense compression can re-set<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rock&rsquo;s  crystal radiometric clock,<br />
old minerals alleging themselves as fresh.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was also  told to lift mine eyes<br />
to the hills from which would come some help.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 68, and it&rsquo;s been a long time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; since rock  swelled up into mountain,<br />
although this snow-melt&rsquo;s one day old, running<br />
&nbsp;in rubble through immensities. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Water learns quickly how to make the best<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of every  accident and here<br />
the pines have finally assumed the pose<br />
they prefer to adopt for years<br />
while, under rock, springs wait to erupt.</p>
<p>Learning ignorance, without help, I leave<br />
to follow the course of millions<br />
of intricate decisions in the world. </p>

<h2><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a>Commentary: </h2>
<p> On the Big South fork of the Poudre River, where I often  hike, there is a sign that proclaims one is entering a wilderness area. It&rsquo;s  impossible for me to pass that sign without thinking that on one side is  civilization, on the other wilderness, which of course is not true. I found it  humorous to imagine seeing that sign and promptly sitting down to examine what  the wilderness is like. The speaker of the poem then thinks, as I often do, of  geology and particularly the issue of time. I am often confronted with the  immediacy of the present (this snow-melt) and the massive &lsquo;deep time&rsquo; of the  geologic past of mountain building. </p>
<p>In the 5th stanza, I couldn&rsquo;t keep from falling into  &lsquo;the pathetic fallacy,&rsquo; giving inanimate objects a human touch (such as &lsquo;water&rsquo;  that &lsquo;learns&rsquo;, pines&rsquo; that &lsquo;prefer&rsquo;). I know this is not scientifically true  and yet I feel that saying it anyway creates a certain feeling or attitude. Of  course, many times such ruminations seeking wisdom turn into a knowledge only  of one&rsquo;s &ldquo;ignorance.&rdquo;&nbsp; The speaker leaves  in the last stanza, somewhat attune to nature: that is, the river has made  &ldquo;millions of intricate decisions&rdquo; in how it will pass over or around rocks in  the stream bed and the speaker, following the streambed back down, follows  those decisions as ignorantly as the water.</p>
<p>Regarding the form of the lines, I knew I was already  working with alternating lines of about 10 syllables and lines of 8, so I  indented the shorter lines on a regular basis with no other intention. The  10-syllable English line produced the famous &lsquo;iambic pentameter&rsquo; of Chaucer,  Shakespeare and Wordsworth, to name a few. The iambic tetrameter line (4  accents and 8 syllables) is more familiar to us from Robert Frost (&ldquo;Whose woods  these are, I think I know&rdquo;). I don&rsquo;t mean that I am writing in an iambic meter  strictly (although the 1st line of the 3rd stanza, to  give just one example, is strict iambic pentameter) but that I&rsquo;m varying and  adjusting accents in what I see as &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; line lengths. </p>
<p>Regarding stanza form, the poem alternates 5-line and 4-line  stanzas, mostly a matter of a new thought, like a paragraph in prose. The last  is &ldquo;only&rdquo; 3 lines and I labored to expand it one more for symmetry&rsquo;s sake but  found only wordiness and had to let it stand.</p>
