<h3>Linda Hasselstrom (author of <em>Between Grass and Sky): </em></h3>
<p>&quot;King introduces a year-long  exploration of nowhere&mdash;that is, North Dakota&mdash;and deftly leads us from  reflections on the past of the entire Great Plains to reflections on the future  of the area. Nowhere is also Everywhere; this writer&rsquo;s thoughts subtly  encompass the history of decline and growth in the plains, and their relevance  to the future&mdash;and this is the main topic of discussion everywhere in the West  at this time.&quot;</p>
<h3>from <em>The  Bloomsbury Review</em>, July-August, 2005, Ron  Steffens</h3>
<p>          In  his exploration of North Dakota history and mythos, King begins at the  hard-to-find headwaters of the Sheyenne   River and follows it  through glacial till, abandoned homesteads, and agro-industrial fields, a world  that is           Nowhere&hellip;  a blank for some because it&rsquo;s too far inland, too far to the north, and lacks  the instant icons of other states&mdash;no Liberty Bell, Disneyland, snow-capped Rockies&hellip;. But Nowhere can expand itself to Anywhere&hellip;. The  same winds of climate and politics blow across the plains, and the same human  nature contributes to progress and blocks it, praises it and complains about  it&mdash;especially in the highway caf&eacute;.</p>
<p>           This  is a world where caf&eacute; philosophers pin our country&rsquo;s hope on the success of  wildcat militias and yet many here dream of bison reinhabiting the prairies.  Here folk can claim that &ldquo;civilization arrived in Wells County&hellip;/in  exactly 1882 with the first social dance and the killing of the country&rsquo;s last  buffalo. It&rsquo;s Nowhere but also Everywhere, a place where King can camp along a  river and remember his favorite line from a Cheyenne song: &ldquo;My friends, only the stones  stay on earth forever.&rdquo; </p>
<h3><em>Booklist</em> (2005) </h3>
<p> King undertakes a classic river journey,  not in a land exotic to him but in North    Dakota, his longtime home. And instead of traveling a  fabled river, he follows the meandering Sheyenne,  an &quot;intermittent,&quot; even &quot;ephemeral,&quot; waterway that threads  across glacier-carved terrain that feels, as King notes in his low-key yet  resonant way, remote even &quot;when you're in the midst of it.&quot; His  journey across the sparsely populated prairie inspires musings on why North Dakota's  population is decreasing, and forays into little-known corners of the region's  somber history. As he ponders the struggles of homesteaders and the cruel war  waged against Native Americans, he captures the aura of a profoundly elemental  place afflicted by both drought and flood. Although he's thwarted in his plan  to canoe on the Sheyenne when he finds after a few days that more portage than  paddling is involved, King absorbs &quot;the silence of the open land and mute  river,&quot; and acquires fresh understanding of the North Dakotan character,  the life of a modest river, and the nature of change.

<p>Every place has a story, even when the  place in question seems to be the middle of nowhere&mdash;along the Sheyenne River  in North Dakota.</p>
<p>But from the beginning of Robert King's  memoir cum natural history tale, we are told that this place is indeed the  middle of somewhere&mdash;the whole continent, in fact&mdash;and even if it weren't, it  would still have a story worth sharing.</p>
<p>King chronicled the natural and cultural  history of the Sheyenne during his last year of living in North Dakota, where he lived for 23 years.</p>
<p>Beginning with the headwaters, which were  nowhere anyone really knew, King traced the river through ghost towns, boom  towns, bedroom communities and lots of land where no one lived at all, sharing  stories of those who used to call the land home and those who still stake their  survival on this unpredictable but beautiful land.</p>
<p>While the book, like the river itself,  takes a while to get going, ultimately it ends up as an engaging tale of a  rugged land and its inhabitants, people who most of the book's readers will  likely have a hard time understanding. What would draw someone, hundreds of  years ago or today, to leave their home and travel west to a desolate, lonely  and wild place where people are truly at the mercy of the land and each other?</p>
<p>The answer, at least for settlers of old,  was cheap land and promised bounty that only occasionally came to pass. Perhaps  the deeper question is why have the descendants of those settlers stayed? Of  course, many have not stayed. The population of the state peaked in the 1930s  and almost every town King passed through has lost population since then.</p>
<p>Still, many call this harsh land home. This  book gives us some idea why as King shares the beauty of the river, the  comforting sameness of the prairie and the variety of the changing seasons. The  stories of people who call Dakota home, even the downright strange ones, are  shared with the compassion and heart of an observer who also cares deeply about  his subject.</p>
<p>This kind of story&mdash;part history, part  ecology tract, part socio-economic study&mdash;could truly be told of any river in  the world, proving rightly that every place has a story if only someone would  take the time to discover it.</p>
<h3>	      from <em>North Dakota</em><em> Quarterly</em>, Winter/Spring, 2006, Robert  W. Lewis</h3>
<p>Here Robert King tells the story he made  out of his riverine voyage enlarged by his gentle (not high-powered,  befuddling) research into the culture, present and past, of the Sheyenne River,  a modestly small river of east central North Dakota along which American  Indians and then European Americans came to swell in the 19th  century: possession, dispossession, and repossession. He has read well in this  area&rsquo;s past&mdash;military, political, social&hellip;.he both pleases and instructs.</p>
<p>[He] alludes to the ancient Greeks from  which he takes Heraclitus&rsquo; admonition: &ldquo;You cannot step twice in the same river  for the water into which you first stepped has flowed on&rdquo;&mdash;meaning &ldquo;that there  is no permanent reality but the reality of change.&rdquo; By both [traveling] the Sheyenne one year and historically reconstructing the  cultures of the valley, Robert King&rsquo;s fine book gently qualifies Heraclitus:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><em>Heraclitus spoke of flux and change, but he  also spoke of the unity binding these changes together. Permanence might be a  relative term; that everything changed was a half-truth. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>from <em>Grand Forks</em><em> Herald</em>, 2005, Doreen Yellow Bird</h3>
<p> &quot;Reading Robert King&rsquo;s <em>Stepping  Twice Into the River: Following Dakota Waters</em> is stepping bravely into the  past and seeing the true face of the North Dakota  prairie&hellip;His journey starts in the center of the state, where many towns reached  their zenith in the early 1900&rsquo;s. Today, some are ghost towns. In these small,  surviving communities, King pulls up a stool in small family cafes or friendly  local bars and listens to the stories. King&rsquo;s book is recommended to those who  like to experience the land from a fresh point of view as he did. But it is  also for those who don&rsquo;t travel those off-roads in the middle of the state or  stop at a small sign that outlines a battle. His adventure is beyond a hike in  a reclusive land, it is understanding the mind and heart of the Prairie and  seeing it come to life. It is well worth reading.&quot;</p>
