<p>On Old Man Laughing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a great man has the heart of a child, Bob King is one  of those who seems to have reversed the aging process by growing &ldquo;greater&rdquo; and  greater as time has passed. He is also the rarest kind of poet, especially now.  The strength of his work comes from the originality of his thought rather than  any pyrotechnical devices. His work is inspired by the things that are the most  fundamental to being human. But the emphasis is not upon the lowest common  denominators. He somehow manages to remember the highest and purest of our  common denominators and to make these available to us again in ways that remind  us that human life can be a thing of beauty and joy to contemplate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>--Jeffrey  Ethan Lee (author of Invisible Sister)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The entire  collection feels like a musical composition&mdash;simple, yet elegant, each poem an  important part of the whole, a &lsquo;vibration&rsquo; of rueful wit and wisdom lingering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>--Dona Stein, author of <em>Entering the Labyrinth</em></p>
<p>If there is a bearable lightness of being, it  informs and leavens the poems in Robert King&rsquo;s <em>Old Man Laughing</em>. The poems are serious, exuberant, occasionally  formal, and full of delight. They can combine the quiet spareness of ancient  Chinese poetry with a wild extravagance and from the two birth a deep humanity.  When you read the opening lines of &ldquo;From the Book of Rope&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;First, there is  love. Secondly, / the square knot&rdquo;&mdash;you know a linguistic and human adventure is  unfolding. The whole book is that adventure, as the flashlight of precise  observation and the transformation of insight into poetry illuminates first  this, then that&mdash;love, rope, music, maps, sorrow, aunts, fireflies, the  accidental. From the child&rsquo;s view in &ldquo;What It Was Like Those Days&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;Even the  dead, I thought then, / grinning as I biked around town, / were happy in their  own way&rdquo;&mdash;to the final lines of &ldquo;Loss&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Especially old, especially alone, / I  laugh as, walking, I falter&rdquo;&mdash;reading these poems will make you feel buoyant,  human, and lucky.</p>
