<h2>Reviews: Some of These Days</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Intelligence and whimsy are seldom wedded as  delightfully as they are in the poems of Robert King. Out of a lifetime of  stories, wide reading and bemused, sometimes jaded, observation, he&rsquo;s fashioned  a persona you will want to hang out with. Pull up a chair and stay a while with  this wonderful book.&rdquo; <br />
    --David Mason, Colorado Poet Laureate            </p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob King writes refreshingly intimate poems that brim with  honesty, humor and rue.&rdquo; <br />
--Wendy Videlock&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;King moves with ease from humor to heartbreak, often in a single poem,  and his language is always fresh and clear. He has the gifts necessary to fulfill  Frost&rsquo;s dictum that a poem &ldquo;begins in delight and ends in wisdom,&rdquo; and readers  will take great pleasure in making that journey with him.&rdquo; <br />
    --Joe Hutchison </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is serious, intelligent, patient,&nbsp;  deeply compassionate poetry about subjects that really matter.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
    --Jared Smith</p>
