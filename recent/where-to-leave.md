title: Choosing Where to Leave
---

<p><em>1. The Corso Death Scene</em></p>
<p>Gregory once told me that<br />
if he were on the street and knew<br />
he were dying, he&rsquo;d slip into<br />
a movie, didn&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>So there were assumptions:<br />
a theater nearby, the right time.<br />
Well, we know now his way<br />
didn&rsquo;t happen&mdash;daughter&rsquo;s house,</p>
<p>hospital. I thought, reading the news,<br />
that a movie would have had<br />
the comfort of closed darkness<br />
and he&rsquo;d have been with others,</p>
<p>a whole roomful staring at lights,<br />
at color, with music, everyone<br />
talking and talking on the screen,<br />
a movie about being alive.</p>
<p><em>2. Clouds</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always hoped I&rsquo;d lie<br />
out on a hill the time death rose,<br />
busy with the clouds and their rich<br />
transient concoctions, the way<br />
they boil up with luxurious names,<br />
while doing, and that sharp blue.</p>
<p><em>3. The Stupid Tree</em></p>
<p>But it will be, outside, some stupid tree<br />
and then I will not &ldquo;see to see,&rdquo;<br />
as Dickinson described. It will be chance,<br />
an insignificant tree with no intention<br />
or lesson or maybe part of a terrible formal garden.</p>
<p><em>4. The Theater of Trees</em></p>
<p>Their leaves will shine like broken pieces<br />
implacably. They will not care<br />
about death, even their own.<br />
And the lights too go out slowly<br />
in the cramped rooms of the leaves,<br />
like small theaters darkening<br />
except that in real life the lights<br />
come on again. Gregory, wake up.<br />
The colored musical clouds have moved on.<br />
Everyone has stopped talking now.</p>


<h2>Commentary<a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a></h2>
<p>The current poet laureate, Joseph Hutchison, posted a poem of mine on his Facebook/Website during National Poetry Month, 2015. He hadn&rsquo;t told me about it so I was pleasantly surprised. It appeared in my 2013 book, <em>Some of These Days.</em></p>
<p>As I discussed the origin and form of some other poems on this site, it occurred to me to do the same here. It&rsquo;s made more current by the fact that I was told in April my interview with Gregory Corso in the early &lsquo;70s at the North Dakota Writers Conference is in an upcoming book of interviews with him.</p>
<p>The idea began with a memory of that interview in which Corso suddenly, and his turns of thought seemed always sudden,&nbsp; mentioned that if he were dying he&rsquo;d go into a movie theater. I asked why and he grinned and shrugged, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; The image stuck with me as an example of &ldquo;choosing where to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I heard of Corso&rsquo;s death in January of 2001, and that it had occurred in a Minnesota hospital, I got a twinge thinking of his earlier comment. I wrote what is now the first section, working with a slightly disjointed line/syntax rhythm (from 6 to 9 syllables as a base) and, when I could bring in the &lsquo;movie&rsquo; idea in the last stanza, thought the poem was finished.</p>
<p>The poem sat, unrevised and not sent out, for some time before I found it again. I seemed to remember that I had told him I wanted to die outside and what is now Part Two of the poem came into existence. It was, at first, a short exercise in sound for me: &ldquo;transient/concoctions/luxurious&rdquo; <br />
is not my usual tone. I didn&rsquo;t want to <em>add</em> it to &ldquo;The Corso Death Scene&rdquo; because that first part seemed finished on its own. I felt the one stanza, though, could be added as a second part. I rarely write in sections but I felt emboldened to try it. </p>
<p>As if <em>that </em>weren&rsquo;t enough, I continued the thought about my wishes for death and their likelihood of happening (rather than a new idea for a new section) and made it a Section Three. Although it&rsquo;s not radical at all, I got a little thrill by starting a section in a poem with &ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp; I then found a way to work in the most startling line of Emily Dickinson I remembered from high school, reading &ldquo;I Heard a Fly Buzz When I Died: death coming on described as &ldquo;and then I could not see to see.&rdquo; Which sounded chilling and final in a way I&rsquo;d never thought of.</p>
<p>And, as I&rsquo;d started one section with a &ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;, I decided to break up the idea of trees and begin the Fourth Section with &ldquo;Their leaves&hellip;&rdquo;. Finally, and this is always the thrilling part of working with poetry, when the lights began to go out in the leaves I realized this is what happens in a movie theater, linking what I felt was moving toward an ending with the opening section through the movie reference. I needed to point out that the darkness of movies is temporary but that of death is permanent. </p>
<p>Of course, the lights come <em>on</em> when a movie is over and I found myself&nbsp; pretending that he fell asleep during the film. &ldquo;The colored musical clouds have moved on&rdquo; directly echoes the first mention of movies, &ldquo;a whole roomful staring at lights,/ at color, with music, everyone/ talking and talking&hellip;&rdquo; I found it comforting to pretend that I could wake him up and life might go on. I also found it necessary to make a grim twist at the end, both that the dialogue has ceased as the movie is over and that once one has died &ldquo;everyone has stopped talking,&rdquo; or, put another way, &ldquo;He could not hear to hear.&rdquo;</p>
