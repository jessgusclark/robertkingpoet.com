<p>I was once told I had  a Planter&rsquo;s Wart <br />
on my foot but I  didn&rsquo;t know why <br />
it would be named for  that guy in the ad <br />
for Planter&rsquo;s Punch,  white suit, Panama hat. </p>
<p>Sixty years later I  stumble on&nbsp;Plantar&rsquo;s <br />
Wart, meaning the sole  in Latin,&nbsp;planta, <br />
so it had nothing to  do with a plantation <br />
or a punch with rum,  sugar, bitters, you know, <br />
including grenadine  (pomegranate juice) <br />
which has nothing to  do with&nbsp;grenadier,&nbsp; </p>
<p>a thought I almost  had. Back then I confused <br />
&ldquo;cavalry&rdquo; and  &ldquo;Calvary&rdquo; on my tongue, <br />
a problem for a  Baptist who watched westerns. <br />
I thought  &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; was a word <br />
my mother made up  (although it could have been <br />
a Greek king) until  someone else said it too. </p>
<p>The wart disappeared.  How many ailments, <br />
how many benefits have  worn away? <br />
But we step on,  through the sweets and bitters, <br />
the way we do, one  sole flat down, the next, <br />
planting one word  after the other, <br />
Christ with his  cavalry, one soldier <br />
on the hill of Calvary  with his grenade, <br />
the pin loosened, and  a cup of rum. <br />
Good King  Miscellaneous on his throne.        </p>
<h2><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a>Form:</h2>
<p> The  first line came out fairly satisfactorily at 10 syllables and I often try to  take that as some kind of charm, that that sets the tone of rhythm so I often  try to follow that. I do think that 10 syllables more than echoes the standard  English iambic pentameter line and is good for such conversational talk in a  poem. Yes, I push many lines a syllable or two over that but few fall short of  that.</p>
<h2>Content: </h2>
<p> I&rsquo;m very aware  of my early experiences with language and I&rsquo;ve told the <em>miscellaneous </em>story, that I thought it was a private word my mother  had made up, to several friends. I had never dealt with my wondering about the  &ldquo;Planter&rsquo;s Wart&rdquo; I had on my foot, diagnosed by a cousin in medicine. When I  looked it up, sixty years later, I found that my notion of <em>Planter</em> was false; that the word was <em>Plantar</em> and I put this information into the poem.</p>
<p>While I was  looking things up, I decided to search for &ldquo;planter&rsquo;s punch&rdquo; and found, among  other ingredients, grenadine, realizing I didn&rsquo;t even know what that was so I  looked <em>that</em> up and found <em>pomegranate</em>.&nbsp; <em>Grenadier</em> was on the same page, of course, and I looked that up, wondering if it had  something to do with <em>grenade</em> (it  did). Another difficult distinction for me at that age was <em>cavalry</em> and <em>Calvary</em> and  that came into the poem.</p>
<p>Then I brought  in the old story of my experience with the word <em>miscellaneous</em> (without the lengthy narrative I usually told it in). </p>
<p>How does one  end a poem that starts out consisting of random, or only personally-directed,  word searches? This poem illustrates one way: try to bring everything previous  together at the end. </p>
<p>After I  remembered the wart had disappeared, required no medical attention, I started  to think about &ldquo;life&rdquo; in general and in a couple of lines realized I needed to  get away from thoughts-on-life-in-general. When I found myself using &ldquo;sweet and  bitters,&rdquo; referring to a recipe for planter&rsquo;s punch, I realized I could bring  the other confusions in and play it straight, as if Christ did have a cavalry  and there was a soldier at Calvary, with a grenade, of course.<br />
The echo of  &ldquo;Good King Wenceslas&rdquo; with &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; gave me my last line. </p>
<p>I take this  poem as an amusement, a trip through language that, after discussing childhood  confusions, ends up by presenting them as the actual reality and stops the poem  there.&nbsp; </p>
