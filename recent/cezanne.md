<h2><strong>The Things of Cezanne</strong></h2>
<p>We stood in Cezanne&rsquo;s  studio <br />
and the guide spoke in  French because&nbsp; <br />
the English tour was  at 5 <br />
and I preferred dinner  more than <br />
understanding any  language. </p>
<p>It was magical and  almost&nbsp; <br />
sacred to stand there,  even in French, <br />
the way it had been  sacred <br />
and almost magical  that morning&nbsp; <br />
to take the bus from  Aix in rain&mdash; <br />
he died of pneumonia  after <br />
painting two hours in  a rain&mdash; <br />
and wind past farms,  hamlets, and wet woods&nbsp; <br />
to stare at the bottom  of Mont <br />
St. Victoire which he  painted more&nbsp; <br />
than fifty times,  whose rocks slanted <br />
fifty yards up to  become fog <br />
and cloud and then fog  again <br />
so we didn&rsquo;t want to  climb it. </p>
<p>At Cezanne's studio,  some things <br />
that were in his still  lifes were on&nbsp; <br />
his shelves lined  around the big room. <br />
You remember the blue  pitcher?&nbsp; <br />
Well, there was that  old Blue Pitcher. <br />
The ochre plate? The  Ochre Plate. </p>
<p>But the biggest thing  stationed there <br />
was a huge stepladder,  legs splayed, <br />
ready for his larger  canvases, <br />
such a rustic piece of  lumber&nbsp; <br />
yet so necessary,  climbing <br />
up to work, climbing  down to work, <br />
maybe thinking<em>&nbsp;This is getting</em> <br />
<em>really old,</em>&nbsp;though he was happy. </p>
<p>And when we left, the  rain came down&nbsp; <br />
again the way it might  have rained&nbsp; <br />
on him, I mean on  every thing <br />
but he was one of  those things then <br />
and we were two of  those things now.          </p>
<h2><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a>Form: </h2>
<p>Once the  first line, a simple statement of fact, came out at 8 syllables (the length of  the standard English/American tetrameter line: &ldquo;Whose woods these are I think I  know&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;We stood in Cezanne&rsquo;s studio&rdquo;) I elected to try to keep that. It can  be scanned as having 4 accents in each line with some variations but I prefer  to be aware of the accents while using the syllable count as my rule. </p>
<h2>Content:</h2>
<p> This poem is  an indication of one of the directions my work is taking these days (2013)  which I&rsquo;d characterize as a kind of playfulness over an echoing of depth.</p>
<p>The details  presented of our trip to Aix-en-Provence a year or so ago are factual. My wife  and I took a bus and got off at the foot of Mont St. Victoire, the subject of  many of Cezanne&rsquo;s paintings, in a combination of fog and rain that really  prevented any climbing or hiking. We took refuge in the one building about a  quarter mile away which, luckily, served coffee, and we waited the hour for the  bus to come back around. Note that most of this narrative is <em>not</em> in the poem. That afternoon we went  to Cezanne&rsquo;s studio, taking the lecture-tour in French which meant only looking  around while someone talked. What struck me, as in the poem, was that many of  the objects of his still lifes were there, on tables and shelves, and what  really struck me was the huge, rustic stepladder he used to get up to his  larger canvases. </p>
<p>The title of  the first working draft was &ldquo;The Stepladder of Cezanne&rdquo; which, although it  didn&rsquo;t stay as title indicates my approach, my mental attitude, which was based  on fun. I thought that title, comparing a great name in art with a common  object, was fun to write and to read. One could write &ldquo;The Teacup of Oscar  Wilde&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Shoelace of Van Gogh&rdquo; with similar results. There are two other  factors in writing this particular poem.</p>
<p>I have always  been afraid of writing &ldquo;travel&rdquo; poems for fear they look like bragging (Here I  am by the Fountain of Something in Venice last summer&mdash;aren&rsquo;t I special to have  been there?) and afraid of writing poems about &ldquo;art&rdquo; for some of the same  reasons (I know this fact about a great painter and you probably don&rsquo;t but  isn&rsquo;t art wonderful and aren&rsquo;t I special?). If you have not read poems like  this, consider yourself lucky. Add <em>death</em> to <em>travel</em> and <em>art</em> and you have the makings of a really pretentious poem, in my  view. </p>
<p>So part of the  humor and &lsquo;messing around&rsquo; with the diction comes from trying to overcome those  fears and frustrate those aren&rsquo;t-I-special responses. <br />
This is why,  looking back at the composing which was not very conscious of itself at the  time, I began with trivial details about the tour&rsquo;s time and dinner and French  rather than a more resounding and noble (pretentious?) tone. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It was  magical and almost sacred&rdquo; is a very true statement but it has the tone of the  aren&rsquo;t-I-special enthusiasm I wanted to avoid. &ldquo;Even in French&rdquo; functions to  bring-down the level of clich&eacute; as does the reversal coming next, &ldquo;the way it  had been sacred and almost magical that morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you repeat a clich&eacute; immediately I think it  shows the writer knows it&rsquo;s a clich&eacute;. </p>
<p>The first  draft ended with an unnecessarily long treatment of Cezanne catching pneumonia  after painting two hours in the rain to get that important death in that  important closing position but, for reasons above, that meant I really wanted  to de-emphasize that.&nbsp; I needed to get  that information in the poem because of the rain we felt that afternoon as we  left but it felt forced with so much emphasis at the end so in revisions it got  condensed and moved into the second stanza where it could just sit and wait for  the poem&rsquo;s end to become relevant.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There <em>was</em> something magical and almost sacred  to see some of the actual objects of his still lifes in this studio but, again,  I didn&rsquo;t want to sound like an intellectual enthusiast so I purposely undercut  the tone with &ldquo;things&rdquo; and&nbsp; bringing in  the reader confidentially and in a colloquial tone (&ldquo;You remember the blue  pitcher? / Well, there was that old Blue Pitcher.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>The fourth  stanza brings in the huge stepladder, so crudely built and so massive that it  demanded my attention the whole time in his studio. In the revisions I  developed a whole stanza comparing his feelings at his age to <em>my</em> feelings at <em>my</em> age and really made a good comparison. This stanza, however, was  eventually deleted, in part due to poet Ted Kooser, to whom I showed a draft,  who advised me that the reader at that point was not really interested in Bob  King&rsquo;s feelings about his age or work. Or words to that effect. Ted is good at  this and good for me because of this.</p>
<p>I take the  last stanza very seriously although, again, the tone is purposely flat. The  rain that day did remind me of the rain that proved to be his death
and I felt  helpless outside and yet connected to the joy of art, of his art,<br />
and I was  standing outside his studio where he might have stood at one time and I was  moved. Still I did not want to become artistic or grandiloquent and needed to  &ldquo;bring down&rdquo; or &ldquo;tone down&rdquo; the thought. When I said it rained on &ldquo;every thing&rdquo;  I realized the import and possibilities of the title and Cezanne became simply  a thing (along with his pitchers and plates) and my wife and I had become  things, simply objects to be rained upon. </p>
<p>There are higher or deeper &ldquo;meanings&rdquo; one could  get out of this poem including something about art and its constancy when  weighed against short human lives, about the nature of rain and the other  elements of nature weighed against our human natures, about the painful or  beautiful irony that among the existing great paintings he made are the  existing subjects of those paintings, et cetera. But I am not as concerned with  those as I am with the functions of that flat colloquial tone addressing huge  noble subjects, that it deals with great art and, indeed, great death almost  breezily and casually. </p>
