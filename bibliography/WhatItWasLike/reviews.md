<h2>Review: What it Was Like</h2>
<p>In <em>What It Was Like</em>, Robert King writes  with a clarity and depth and a regard for our frail humanity that is  refreshing--&quot;pressing a crisp attention to the words.&quot; He  offers&nbsp;us poems that make us laugh and reflect and remember &quot;This  time. That. And the dancing in between.&quot; This book is a treasure. </p>
<p>(Lisa Zimmerman, <em>How the Garden Looks from Here</em>)</p>
