<h3>Winner  of the 2011 Grayson Books Chapbook Competition</h3>
<p>&ldquo;These  pages sing the details of Auguste Rodin&rsquo;s life and work with yearning and  truth&hellip;These poems&rsquo; ways of breaking down objects and events are as clear and  accurate as Rodin&rsquo;s own work. In fact, that&rsquo;s the best compliment I could give <em>Rodin  &amp; Company</em>&mdash;the book bears the weight of Rodin&rsquo;s great life and works  and carries them even farther into our hearts.<br />
--Jack  Bedell          </p>
<p>&ldquo;An  unfolding discovery, done over time with great care and insight. Robert King  unites poetic craft, traditional and organic form, and vision as well as anyone  writing today.&rdquo;<br />
--Jared Smith</p>
<p>&ldquo;King's work, I think, does what good ekphrastic poems should  do--uses Rodin as an occasion for a poem, not as scenery or a replacement for  the poetic image.&nbsp; I like, too, how history and Rilke and even King  himself enter these poems.&nbsp; Again I think that's the nature of good  ekphrastic (or any) poetry.&nbsp; Both statue and poem are bigger than the  individual parts.&rdquo;&nbsp; <br />
