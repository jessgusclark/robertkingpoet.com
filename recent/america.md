title: In America
---

<p>The young man, farm-boy type and  blonde,<br />
comes to my outside table and  asks,<br />
because I&rsquo;m smoking a cigar, <br />
for a cigar, and lingers, talking: <br />
just out of jail this morning <br />
(for breaking probation) he has<br />
the bland unknowing innocence<br />
of the more quietly disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stole a cigar from a store once,&rdquo;<br />
he remarks, &ldquo;that had these pilgrims on it.<br />
What kind was that?&rdquo; And I don&rsquo;t  know.<br />
&ldquo;And a wagon,&rdquo; which doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>Then a girl arrives, both at the  shelter<br />
these days, she&rsquo;s ADD and on her  meds, <br />
he&rsquo;s off of his. She&rsquo;s a good  worker, <br />
she insists, but somehow can&rsquo;t  keep <br />
a job--that&rsquo;s why she became a  dancer.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m not sure of that  logic,<br />
I can&rsquo;t keep from imagining her <br />
peeled and skinny under colored  lights<br />
until the boy asks for another  cigar.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Finally they rise and leave, the  way<br />
our grandparents, the pilgrims,  wrecked<br />
the Mayflower on Plymouth Rock,<br />
stole a few wagons and jostled  west,<br />
arriving in the shelter of the  Promised <br />
Land, who then shed their clothes <br />
and began their jobs of dancing <br />
wildly, guilty and guiltless,<br />
almost naked in America. </p>

<h2><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a>Commentary:</h2>
<p>This is one of those poems that  presented all its material in an actual encounter with the two young people  involved. The situation seemed interesting enough for me to simply &lsquo;write down  what happened&rsquo; and it took the first four stanzas to do it. The mention of  &lsquo;pilgrims&rsquo; made me think of American history and how it might look if these two  were our historical representatives so I conflated standard images of American  history with their own, to me, strange lives. Later, I thought the boy might  have thought of pilgrims when he saw the picture on a Dutch Masters cigar-box,  although I still don&rsquo;t know where the &lsquo;wagon&rsquo; came from. </p>
<p>The form of the poem is a rough  approximation of an 8-syllable line, varying from 7 to 9. In a lot of my work  I&rsquo;m conscious of using a syllabic form, either strictly or loosely, which  resembles the 8 syllables of a tetrameter line or the 10 syllables of a  pentameter line in traditional English prosody.
